Library to enhance C++ built-in vector class

This library contains various utility functions/classes to support std::vector usage. In particular, the class called "stdvec_wrap" wraps (without copying) std::vector and allows slicing (either continuous range, or indices), accessing elements, deleting multiple elements with indices, overloaded operators ==, >, etc. for finding and indexing, etc.

See demo and usage near the end of the source file.
